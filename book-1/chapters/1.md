# Chapter 1: Shattered Pieces

## A Prison Called “Home”

The room I found myself in was small and cramped, with peeling wallpaper and a single, flickering lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. The air was stale, thick with the scent of the suffering of my body. The only window was covered with old curtains covering the iron bars that even sunlight couldn’t penetrate. Left alone letting me escape.

It was a depressing, oppressive space that only served to remind me of my misery. This was a place where I have been living for my entire life. No, it might be I just pretended to be alive.

A tall and old mirror was placed beside my bed. It leaned on the wall. It was as tall as me, or as short as me. My short body stood up in front of the mirror, while bearing the pain between my legs that was caused by yesterday’s routine. My heart pounded in my chest as I stared at the cracked mirror before me.

The face that looked back at me was a distorted image of despair, my blue eyes dulled by years of abuse and torment. My once smooth, pale skin was now marred by a network of bruises, cuts, and scars. A particularly fresh bruise stood out on my cheek, a painful reminder of the prison I called home.

That mirror was the silent witness of my years of suffering.

While I was diving into the blank eyes of a woman in the mirror, the sound of my father's heavy footsteps approaching my room sent shivers down my spine. I knew he would come for me again, as he always did.

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block out the memories of his touch, but they were etched in my mind like an indelible stain.

"Evelyn," my mother sneered from the hallway, her voice dripping with disdain, "your father's looking for you. Don't keep him waiting."

I shuddered, my breath catching in my throat. The door to my room creaked open, and my father's imposing figure filled the doorway. His cold eyes scanned my body, and a sinister smile spread across his face.

"Ready for another round, my precious girl?" he said, his voice dripping with malice.

My heart felt like it would burst from my chest as I struggled to find my voice. "Please, not tonight," I whispered, my words barely audible.

My father's laugh was a low, menacing growl. "You don't have a choice, sweetheart." He reached for me, and I instinctively flinched away.

"Please, I'm begging you. Just leave me alone tonight," I choked out, my voice trembling with fear.

"Enough," he barked, his tone icy and cruel. "You know better than to speak back to me."

As his grip tightened around my wrist, a sudden and inexplicable surge of energy pulsed through my veins. At that moment, something inside me snapped. Desperate and defiant, I wrenched my arm free from his grasp, turned, and ran.

But he caught me, his fingers digging into my arm like talons. I cried out in pain, tears streaming down my face as I struggled to break free. "Let me go!" I screamed, my voice raw with desperation.

My father's grip only tightened, his face twisted with rage. "You're not going anywhere, you ungrateful little brat," he snarled, his breath hot on my face.

## A Trauma

As he dragged me back towards my room, I could feel the memories of my past trauma welling up inside me, threatening to swallow me whole.

*The first time it happened, I was just thirteen. I had come home from school, my heart pounding with excitement as I clutched a report card full of A's. I thought my father would be proud of me, but when I showed it to him, he only sneered.*

*"That's all you have to offer?" he spat, his eyes cold and dismissive. "You're nothing but a burden, a worthless waste of space."*

*That night, he came to my room, his intentions dark and twisted. I didn't understand what was happening, only that it was wrong, and it hurt. The pain, both physical and emotional, was unbearable, and I sobbed silently, my body shaking with fear and disgust.*

*Over the years, the abuse continued, and my mother's cruel taunts only added to my misery. She blamed me for my father's actions, calling me names that cut deeper than any physical wound.*

*"You're a disgrace," she hissed one night after I had cried out in pain, unable to bear the agony any longer. "You're the reason our family is falling apart."*

As my father dragged me down the hallway, his grip bruising my arm, I felt a surge of defiance rise within me. I couldn't let him continue to control and destroy me any longer. With every ounce of strength I possessed, I wrenched my arm free from his grasp and threw myself at him, the impact sending us both crashing to the floor.

As we struggled, I could see the fear and surprise in his eyes, and it only fueled my determination. I had been beaten down and broken, but I refused to let him win.

But my mother brought an iron golf stick and hit me. I heard a cracking sound from my right ribs, and an intense wave of pain washed over me. I gasped, my vision blurring as I collapsed onto the floor, unable to move.

"You will never defy us again," she hissed, her eyes devoid of any love or compassion. My father loomed over me, his anger replaced with a sickening satisfaction. They both stood there, watching as I writhed in pain, tears streaming down my face.

I was forced to bear another night of torment, my broken body and spirit only adding to the darkness that enveloped me. As I lay there, bruised and battered, I couldn't help but wonder if this was all my life would ever be—endless suffering, with no hope of escape.

## A Portal to Another World

After my father was satisfied, he left me lying on the cold floor. I couldn't cry anymore as I had used up all my tears that night. My head slowly turned to the right, my gaze catching the tall mirror which had started to crack.

The cracks began to spread, creating an intricate web of jagged lines across the surface of the mirror. As I watched, I noticed a strange, otherworldly glow emanating from within the cracks. It seemed to pulsate, growing brighter and more vibrant with each passing second.

Curiosity mingling with fear, I dragged my battered body towards the mirror, the pain in my ribs almost unbearable. I reached out a trembling hand, hesitating for a moment before placing my fingers on the shimmering surface. The moment my skin made contact with the glass, the glow intensified, enveloping my hand and creeping up my arm.
